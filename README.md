# Web_Scrapping


Web scraping is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites. This technique mostly focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data (database or spreadsheet).

We will use Python for scraping because of its ease .It has a library known as ‘Beautiful Soup’ which assists this task.

There is no universal solution for web scraping because the way data is stored on each website is usually specific to that site. In fact, if you want to scrape the data, you need to understand the website’s structure.


Let us take up the example of the url "https://www.flipkart.com/search?q=books&otracker=search&otracker1=search&marketplace=FLIPKART&as-show=on&as=off" and get the details like Product Name and Product Specifications from there.
